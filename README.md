# Music-Scales-Study-Companion

This program is designed to assist the aspiring music theorist in learning the diatonic modes. Music Scales Study Companion has two settings. The first returns any requested mode with any requested tonic (starting note). This allows the user to refer to the notes of any scale as they practice. The second setting is a timed challenge. The user selects an amount of time, during which a random scale is generated and displayed every 15 seconds. This exercise challenges the user's knowledge and skill with improvisation. 

Use arrow keys + enter to cycle through the menus.
